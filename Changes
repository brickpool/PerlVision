1.x     July 2000
        Moved docs to pod format and put PV in CVS. Brought PV packaging up to
        date with a 2 digit version number and a Makefile.PL (sorry no!).
        Hopefully this means Ashish going to finally do some work on PV soon!

0.2     April 1995
        Ashish found Will Setzer's Curses interface for Perl and did a rewrite
        using curses/ncurses. Tremendously speeded up and much more portable.
        Turned into a real Perl 5 module. Many thanx to Tim Bunce for helping
        clear up my confusion about modules.

0.1     March 1995
        First release. Didn't use curses, did its own screen optimization, which
        was in Perl and very slow.
